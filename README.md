# Ba.Ka
## My own personal website.

![](https://github.com/hzmusician/Ba-Ka/blob/main/Photos/readme-gif.gif)

My portfolio website where I briefly describe myself and what I do.
I tried to prepare a minimal and aesthetic design as much as possible on this website, which includes the technologies I know and use, where all my social media links are combined under one roof, and where I have goals and plans.

To visit now:
[Ba.Ka](https://karahan.dev)

* Background: `#0711e6`
* Background: `#0710c5`
* Font Color: `#fff`
* Foot Bg: `#1c1c1c`
* Foot Font Color: `#cccccc`

Font families:

My goal is to make this site bigger and more interactive day by day. If I learn Three.js in the future, I plan to add even little games.
In addition, I write my coding accordingly so that it works smoothly on all devices, thanks to the responsive design.

To-Do List:
- [x] Responsive Design
- [ ] Completion of the communication part
- [ ] Making it interactive
- [ ] Adding minigames or something similar
- [ ] "Portfolio" section that will describe myself in a much more detailed but not boring way

I want it to be a space where people can learn about me, see what I've done and discover my potential without getting bored when they visit my site.

I hope I can complete my project as a beautiful, prominent, liked and usable website in line with my goals.
